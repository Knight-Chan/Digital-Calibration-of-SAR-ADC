# Digital-Calibration-of-SAR-ADC
Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC Digital Calibration

This Open-source Project contains:

0. A Run file to auto-test the ADC model and output its dynamic performance and also the averaging energy consumption.

1. Behavioral Model file of a popular SAR ADC architecture proposed by Liu et al. (see Liu et al. - 2010 - A 10-bit 50-MSs SAR ADC with a monotonic capacitor switching procedure)

2. Capacitor Mismatch Calibration Method I and II from our unpublished work (not available now).

3. Fast Fourier Transfromation (FFT) file to test the dynamic performance of the SAR ADC beharvioral model.

4. Hodiewindow function file which is needed for doing the FFT.
